Heroes of PyMoli Data Analysis

Three Observable trends:
Male by far has the highest number of users by gender. However, this does not appear to have a great impact on the average purchase price, which are all relatively close.
The same can be said about age, with 20-24 making by far the highest number of purchases, but their average purchase is actually lower than two other age groups. With 35-39 having the highest average purchase price by age group.
Most profitable items appear to have no connection to the most popular items. With none of the top 5 of most profitable falling in the top 5 most popular.
